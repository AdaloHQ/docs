Make sure to follow these standards when setting the name, description, library logo, and component thumbnails:

## Name

- The name should be:
  - A noun
  - Descriptive
  - No more than 3-5 words
- The name cannot include "Adalo" or "Component"
- Including other brand names (such as the company making the component) is discouraged.
- Each word in the name should be capitalized, and each word should be separated by spaces.

## Description

- The description should be 1-3 sentences and should concisely and precisely describe what the library does.
- Sentences should end in punctuation.
- Avoid using the library name or mentioning Adalo in the description.
- The description should give the maker a good idea of the functionality of the library, either in use cases or features.

## Logo

The logo in the marketplace is a chance for you to show off your component in a branded way. So while the thumbnail is meant to be a representation of what will actually show up when it’s in the app, the logo is a chance for you to have a little more fun and it’s more of an icon.

- You can use any colors you want.
- The image will be cropped to a circle so make sure your square image has enough space around it that things don’t get cropped off when it’s turned into a circle.
- The logos tend to either be brand logos or icon symbols for what it is.
- The logo shouldn’t be the same thing as the thumbnail.

## Thumbnail

- Your thumbnail should be `312px` (width) by `268px` (height)
- The thumbnail should be a **simplified vector representation** of the component on a white background as it will appear when it’s in the editor view.
- Please use the following grays (from lightest to darkest) to create the representation of the component.
  - #EEEEEE
  - #E0E0E0
  - #BDBDBD
  - #9E9E9E
  - #757575
- Try to avoid text. Instead what works well is just using rounded rectangles as a simplified version of “text”.
- Can’t be a GIF.

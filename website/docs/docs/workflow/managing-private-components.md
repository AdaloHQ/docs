When you publish a component, you have the option to make it public or private.

Publishing a public component immediately adds it to the "Under Review" tab of the editor for everyone on your team. 

## Adding a Private Component to a Team

To make a private component available to your team, click on the profile icon in the top right corner of your screen, and select "Developers" from the dropdown menu.

Now you will see a modal screen containing all of your libraries. Find the library you want to add to your team, then select the icon on the right hand side. Then hover over the "Add To" option to see all of your teams, and select the one you would like to have access to this library.

Now the component should be available to everyone on your team under the "Private" tab in the editor.

## Removing a Private Component from a Team

To remove a private component from a team, just go back to the "Developers" tab and find the library you want to remove. Then click the right hand icon again, hover over the "Remove From" option, and select the team you want to remove this library from.

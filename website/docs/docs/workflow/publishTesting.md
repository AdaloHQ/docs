title: Testing After Publishing
---

After you publish and before the team approves your library (or a new version), you can access your components while they are in review.

To do this:

- Go to your developers page in the editor (Profile icon -> Developers)
- Select a "Testing Team" from the dropdown.
- Now, any apps inside that team will see your library's components in a new dropdown in the "Add Components" called "Under Review"

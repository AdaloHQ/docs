After you publish a public library, it will be automatically marked for review. The new version will be made live once the Adalo team reviews and approves it.

While the new version is in review, you can still access it!

To do this:

- Go to your developers page in the editor (Profile icon -> Developers)
- Select a "Testing Team" from the dropdown.
- Now, any apps inside that team will see your library's components in a new dropdown in the "Add Components" called "Under Review"

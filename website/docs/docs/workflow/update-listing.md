title: Update Your Library Listing
---

All information about your library is stored in the `adalo.json` file. See the [adalo.json documentation](/api-reference/adalo-json) for more information about what the file supports.

:::note
If you created your library before March of 2022, you can generate this file by updating to the latest version of the CLI, and running either `npx adalo update` or `npx adalo publish`.
:::

From here, tweak whatever you need to, and then run `npx adalo update` to update your library listing.

Submitting a paid library is easy! All you need to do is select the `paid` option when publishing a new library:

Once your library publishes, the Adalo team will review your components and will be in touch with you to get your library approved. 

Premium libraries must include **demo link** for your library. You can add this during the publishing process. The demo should link to a preview of an Adalo app that showcases your library's components.

You will need to sign up for a Stripe Express account in order to sell premium components in the Adalo Marketplace. You can find the signup link in the “My Libraries” Tab of the "Developers" modal.

:::note
If you already had a library in development, you may need to upgrade your cli to get paid publishing to work: `yarn upgrade @adalo/cli --latest`. Additionally, if you would like to convert your library to a premium one, please contact the team for more information.

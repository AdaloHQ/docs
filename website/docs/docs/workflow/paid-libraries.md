:::caution
Our paid marketplace is currently in beta. Even if you submit a paid library, it may not be accepted.
:::

Submitting a paid library is easy! All you need to do is select the `paid` option when publishing a new library:

Once your library publishes, the Adalo team will review your components and will be in touch with you to get your library approved. Reach out to the team for more information regarding how to get paid, etc.

Paid libraries must include **demo link** for your library. You can add this during the publishing process. The demo should link to a preview of an Adalo app that showcases your library's components.

:::note
If you already had a library in development, you may need to upgrade your cli to get paid publishing to work: `yarn upgrade @adalo/cli --latest`. Additionally, if you would like to convert your library to a paid one, please contact the team for more information.

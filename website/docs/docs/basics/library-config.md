Inside the folder for your package, you will find a file called `package.json`. The `package.json` has two main types of information: NPM specific information, and Adalo-specific information. Most of the Adalo-specific information is stored under the `Adalo` prop.

Many settings will be automatically generated for you with the `create-adalo-component` tool. See [publishing](/docs/workflow/publishing) for a list of required props before you publish and see the [API Reference](/api-reference/configuration/package-json) for a more detailed look.

To publish your component, all you need to do is run `npx adalo publish`. The command will bundle your library, publish it to Adalo's npm registry, and add it to Adalo's component registry.

Before you publish, make sure that your `package.json` is fully filled out. See [publishing](/docs/workflow/publishing) for more details.

Publishing is currently not supported on Windows.

To publish your component, all you need to do is run `npx adalo publish`. The command will bundle your library and add it to Adalo's component registry.

Before you publish, make sure that your `package.json` is fully filled out. See [publishing](/docs/workflow/publishing) for more details.

:::note
When you publish, you have the option to make your component public or private. Read more about managing access to private components [here](/docs/workflow/managing-private-components).

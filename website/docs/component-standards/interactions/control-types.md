## Prop-Type "Control"

There are some situations where your prop should use a specialized control type, including, but not limited to:

- `slider` should be used for any number input with a minimum and maximum value.
- `menu` should be used in any instance where the maker must choose from a fixed number of options.

For more information on control types, see the [Control Types](/docs/interactions/control-types) documentation.  
For a complete list of control types, see the [Controls Reference](/docs/configuration/manifest-json#controls-reference) in the component manifest docs.

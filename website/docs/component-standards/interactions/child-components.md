Child components should be used to group related props whenever your component contains props that could be grouped into multiple categories. Child components should:

* Be named in a way that describes their purpose and how the props are related to each other.
* Be grouped so that each prop in a child component is related in how they interact with the component.
* Contain an empty state when applicable.
* Should be able to be enabled and disabled when applicable. See [conditional control](docs/interactions/conditional-control)

For more information, see the [child components](/docs/interactions/child-components) documentation.

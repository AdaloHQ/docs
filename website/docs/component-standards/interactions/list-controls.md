## Disabling List Controls

There are some situations where you should disable list controls, such as sorting and filtering. In general, any time that a list control either doesn't make sense in the context of you're component or doesn't have any effect on how the component is rendered, then the control should be disabled.

For more info on disabling list controls, see [Working with Adalo Lists](/docs/interactions/control-types#working-with-adalo-lists-role-and-reference).  
For a complete list of list controls, see the [`listControl`](/docs/configuration/manifest-json#listcontrol) section of the component manifest docs.

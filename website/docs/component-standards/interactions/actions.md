Follow these standards when connecting your component to Adalo:

- Add actions everywhere sensible. For example, if your component has a button, there should an action prop tied to that button that gets called whenever the button is pressed. See the [actions](actions) documentation for more information on how Adalo actions work with your component.
- Add action arguments to actions, when sensible. For example, in the stopwatch component, the lap time is an action argument to the lap action. Read more about action arguments in the [actions](actions) documentation.

title: External APIs
---

The use of 3rd party APIs in your components is allowed, but you should be aware of the license and attribution requirements of all APIs you use. 3rd party APIs should also be reputable, well maintained, and not introduce any security vulnerabilities to makers, end users, or the Adalo ecosystem as a whole. If you are unsure of the license or attribution requirements of an API, or whether or not an API is reputable, please contact the Adalo team.

Your component should be able to gracefully handle the case where an API is not available, providing a message to the user. Additionally, your component should not make excessive calls to external APIs, as this can lead to performance issues and high data usage for end users.

The use of 3rd party dependencies in your components is allowed, but you should be aware of the license and attribution requirements of all dependencies you use. 3rd party dependencies should also be reputable, well maintained, and not introduce any security vulnerabilities to makers, end users, or the Adalo ecosystem as a whole. If you are unsure of the license or attribution requirements of a dependency, or whether or not a dependency is reputable, please contact the Adalo team. 

While most major dependencies will be compatible with the Adalo ecosystem, we do not guarantee support for any 3rd party packages.

Each library and component must follow some design rules in order to be approved:

- Your library must have a logo. See the [library logo reference](/docs/standards/component-listing#logo) for more information.
- Each component must have a thumbnail. See the [component thumbnail reference](/docs/standards/component-listing#thumbnail) for more information.
- Manifest colors should default to App Branding colors whenever possible. See the [colors reference](colors-branding) for more information.
- Component sizing should be dynamic to the device size. See [resizing](resizing) for more information.

There are a variety of UX design requirements too. See the [UX design requirements](/docs/standards/manifest) for more information.

The logo in the marketplace is a chance for you to show off your component in a branded way. So while the thumbnail is meant to be a representation of what will actually show up in the app, the logo is more of an icon. And it's a chance for you to have a little more fun!

- You can use any colors you want.
- The image will be cropped to a circle so make sure your square image has enough space around it that things don’t get cropped off when it’s turned into a circle.
- The logos tend to either be brand logos or icon symbols for what it is.
- The logo shouldn’t be the same thing as the thumbnail.

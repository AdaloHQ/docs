title: Component Thumbnails
---

- Your thumbnail should be `312px` (width) by `268px` (height)
- The thumbnail should be a **simplified vector representation** of the component on a white background as it will appear when it’s in the editor view.
- Please use the following grays (from lightest to darkest) to create the representation of the component.
  - #EEEEEE
  - #E0E0E0
  - #BDBDBD
  - #9E9E9E
  - #757575
- Try to avoid text. Instead what works well is just using rounded rectangles as a simplified version of “text”.
- Can’t be a GIF.
